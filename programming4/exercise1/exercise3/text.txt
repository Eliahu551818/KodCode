input = num
steps:
    1- check wheather the number is >0 and <11
    2- set i to 1. set multiplier to 1 
    3- set line to empty string
    4- add to line the string of i*multiplier\t
    5- add 1 to multiplier
    6- do step 5 until multiplier is bigger than num
    7- print string, and add 1 to i
    8- do step 3 until i is bigger than num
